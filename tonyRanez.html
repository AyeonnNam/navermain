    <h2>Toney Ranez Miss You </h2>
   <p>
    Took time to get you
Took time to let you know
Tried to forget you
You're unforgettable
There's twenty-four hours in a day, I think about you more than twenty-four times
Just trying not to think about you but you've been on my mind
I got nothing for you but time
'Cause you always end up by my side
Through loving you, I needed time
I needed time, and now I'm like
Can I hit it like that?
Like this, like that? Uh-huh, you know
Can I kiss it like that?
Like this, like that? Remember that
Heaven, it feels like that
I won't lie to you, no, no
Can I hit it like that?I've been waiting
For you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you
I've been waiting on and on and
Took time to find you
You left to go away
Must I remind you, feelings don't go astray, no
There's twenty-four hours in a day, I think about you more than twenty-four times
Just trying not to think about you but you've been on my mind
I got nothing for you but time
'Cause you always end up by my side
Through loving you, I needed time
I needed time, and now I'm like
Can I hit it like that?
Like this, like that? Uh-huh, you know
Can I kiss it like that?
Like this, like that? Remember that
Heaven, it feels like that
I won't lie to you, no, no
Can I hit it like that? I've been waiting
For you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you, you, you
Oh you
I've been waiting
Oh yes, it's true, true, true, true
I can be different for you, you, you, you
Show me the things I gotta do, do, do, do
I will be different for you, you, you, you
You, woah
