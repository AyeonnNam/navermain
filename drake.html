    Hold on, hold on, fuck that
    Fuck that shit
    Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again
    Wait a minute
    Fuck that shit
    Still on this motherfuckin' record
    I'ma play this motherfucka for y'all
    Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on
    I'll sound a whole lot better
    Listen
    Seeing you got ritualistic
    Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
    'Cause I'm fallin' apart
    Yeah, tension
    Between us just like picket fences
    You got issues that I won't mention for now
    'Cause we're fallin' apart
    Passionate from miles away
    Passive with the things you say
    Passin' up on my old ways
    I can't blame you, no, no
    Passionate from miles away
    Passive with the things you say
    Passin' up on my old ways
    I can't blame you, no, no
    Listen
    Harder buildin' trust from a distance
    I think we should rule out commitment for now
    'Cause we're fallin' apart
    Leavin'
    You're just doing that to get even
    Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
    They keep fallin' apart
    Passionate from miles away
    Passive with the things you say
    Passin' up on my old ways
    I can't blame you, no, no
    Passionate from miles away
    Passive with the things you say
    Passin' up on my old ways
    I can't blame you, no, no
    Um, trying to think of the right thing to say
   </p>
